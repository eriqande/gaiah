# processing data from genetic assignments



#' Convert posteriors to particular genetic reporting groups into raster
#'
#' When birds have been assigned to breeding groups or "general areas" as in Ruegg et al. 2014
#' then the posterior probabilty with which the birds were assigned to the groups needs to be
#' "smeared out" in a raster over the spatial extent of the groups.
#' @param G long format data frame like breeding_wiwa_genetic_posteriors.  Has to have columns of ID, region, and posterior
#' @param R a RasterStack like "genetic_regions".  The sum of these should be the total known range.
#' The names of the regions in R must be the same as the entries in the "region" column in G.
#' @return This returns a list of rasters for each bird in G.  The entries in the raster
#' are the posterior probability of being from that cell.  This assumes that birds are equally likely
#' to come from any cell within the group's region.  It doesn't return a rasterStack because you
#' can't subset rasterStacks to change orders, etc., and it mangles names.

    names(gp) <- as.character(df$region)
    gp <- gp[names(R)]  # make sure they are in the correct order (FUTURE: error check the names)

    # this smears posterior probability into each region so that the sum over cells
    # in each region is the posterior probability of being from that region, then the calc
    # function sums over all the layers.  Way to go Robert Hijman! ...lovely, compact sytax
